# Modular Monolith E-Commerce

---

## Project Goals

This project is built as a learning and showcase project with the following goals:

- Demonstrate **distributed backend system design**
- Apply **event-driven architecture** patterns
- Practice **domain-driven design (DDD)**
- Build **real-time messaging workflows**
- Implement **production-ready concepts** such as:
    - Idempotency
    - Asynchronous processing
    - Observability
    - Service boundaries
- Deploy using **containerized infrastructure**

This project is intentionally designed as a system-level backend platform rather than a simple CRUD application.
